## Setup: [](https://hexo.io/docs/setup.html)




### Initial Project Hierarchy

This is what your project folder will look like once you've run the `hexo init <folder>` command:

```
<project_root>
    _config.yml
    package.json
    scaffolds
    source
        _drafts
        _posts
    themes

```

#### _config.yml

This is the site configuration file. Open it an start configuring!



#### package.json

Application data file. The EJS, Stylus and Markdown renderers are installed by default. If you want, you can uninstall them later.

#### Scaffolds

[Scaffold](https://hexo.io/docs/writing.html#Scaffolds) folder. When you create a new post, Hexo bases the new file on the scaffold.

When creating posts, Hexo will build files based on the corresponding file in scaffolds folder. For example:
```
$ hexo new photo "My Gallery"
```

When you run this command, Hexo will try to find photo.md in the scaffolds folder and build the post based on it. The following placeholders are available in scaffolds:



| Placeholder   |       Description     |
| layout        | Layout                |
| title         | Title                 |
| date          | File created date     |


#### Source folder
Source folder. This is where you put your siteâ€™s content. Hexo ignores hidden files and files or folders whose names are prefixed with `_` (underscore) - except the `_posts` folder. Renderable files (e.g. Markdown, HTML) will be processed and put into the `public` folder, while other files will simply be copied.
