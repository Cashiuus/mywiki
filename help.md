# Code and Highlighting

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

### Python Highlighting
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```


# Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

```<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>```



# Setting up Github Pages to host this project as a site

[Github Creating Project Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/)

1. From an existing repository, create a branch named 'gh-pages'
2. In order to verify a build when you push to your Page's repository, you must first verify your email address.
3. Create an index.html file and commit with the new branch
4. After you push to the gh-pages branch, your site will be available at "http(s)://<user>.github.io/<projectname>".
