ITS Wiki

## My Wiki

[Wiki Site](http://Cashiuus.github.io/mywiki)


## Purpose

I've tried many different types of Wiki platforms in the past in an effort to maintain an
effective reference resource to supplement a poor memory. The need for something portable
has led me to transition away from local MediaWiki installations to trying MDWiki.

If it works out, you will notice this project growing. If it doesn't appear effective, this
repository may disappear; time will tell the tale.




## Run Wiki Locally

Just cd into the root project directory and run the `run-pyserver.sh` script.






See [MDWiki](http://www.mdwiki.info/) for official documentation and details.
