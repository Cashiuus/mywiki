Security & Pentesting Wiki
==========================


This is a wiki and repository for all security and programming notes I've collected and attempted to organize.



## Top Areas of Focus

* [Python Django](pages/programming/python-django/index.md) & [cookiecutter](pages/programming/python-django/cookiecutter.md)









### Credit
I owe credit to the following projects, old and recent, for some worthwhile content that should be in a security wiki:

* PwnWiki - [](https://github.com/pwnwiki/pwnwiki.github.io)
* CTFWiki - [](https://github.com/pwnwiki/ctfwiki)
